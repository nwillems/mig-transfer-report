\section{Design}
The problem this project tries to solve, revolves around tranferring data 
between research stations and the MiG. Its intended design is described below.

The solution focuses on two key aspects, authentication and temporary
autorisation and transfer of data. These two aspects represent their own 
sub-system which are designed independently, but with eachother in mind.

\paragraph{Data transfer} the data being transferred has a high price, it is
therefore vital to the system that the stored data exactly matches what was
originally recorded. Another point regarding transfer is the size of the
recorded data, it is expected that the system will move terabytes of data
between itself and MiG, this has to happen in a timely-manner.

The data transfer has these two factors as criteria for succes, reliability and
speed.

\paragraph{Authentication}
